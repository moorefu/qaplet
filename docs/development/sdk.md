# Embed SDK development

The initial SDK provides one owner-thread Runtime with one private Context,
synchronous Script evaluation, strict copied results, synchronized POD snapshots and
separate close/destroy operations. `include/qaplet.h` is the public contract.
The engine allocator tracks backing ownership from its first allocation.
Before publication, creation installs only engine intrinsics: no user JavaScript,
Host modules or external native resources run. Failed creation therefore reclaims
outstanding backing blocks directly, without traversing a partial engine graph.
Published instances use normal Context/Runtime finalization during close.
Query capability bits before using a feature; modules, Promise pumping, host
modules, events and stop are added by subsequent M1 tickets.

The copied-values capability adds exact signed/unsigned 64-bit BigInt, strict
UTF-8 strings (including NUL), and safely copied Uint8Array views. Number stays
double. Results reject arbitrary objects, functions, proxies, shared/detached
views, lone surrogates and values above the 1 MiB byte limit without conversion
hooks. `qaplet_get_result` uses the caller's buffer and explicit capacity; a
short buffer returns the required payload length and leaves the stable result
available for retry. String payloads do not include an extra NUL terminator.

Every diagnostic is caller-owned. Safe exception text is bounded to 1023 bytes;
it uses primitive thrown strings or own string data messages on intrinsic Error
objects, and never calls a getter, Proxy trap or user conversion. Short/zero
diagnostic buffers retain the stable code, and positive capacities receive a
NUL terminator with a truncation flag where needed. UTF-8 truncation retains
whole codepoints. Result copies count toward native storage and are released
by the next accepted execution or close; rejected calls preserve the old result.

Build on Ubuntu with verified pinned inputs and the main worktree cache:

```sh
python3 scripts/sdk.py build --output-dir out/sdk/artifacts --report out/sdk/build.json
python3 scripts/sdk.py run --build-report out/sdk/build.json \
  --artifact out/sdk/artifacts/qaplet-host.com \
  --loader-dir /path/to/supplied/native/loaders --report out/sdk/run.json
```

On Windows use `python` and omit `--loader-dir` (the native PE route).
The run command validates supplied SDK/APE bytes and executes the C Host; it
never compiles. Loader selection, process evidence, APE audits and packaging
reuse the existing consumers. Output must be new or empty for each build.

The SDK ships `sdk/include/qaplet.h`, `sdk/lib/libqaplet.a` and its concomitant
`sdk/lib/.aarch64/libqaplet.a`, a public-only C example, and license notices.
Ubuntu's locked `cosmocc` can compile that example against the public include
directory and link the archive. The producer compiles the distributed
`sdk/host-contract.c` against that public include directory and archive before
packaging the Host APE. Its scalar case follows the minimal example; additional
cases check the currently implemented SDK contracts.

The existing v3 lock continues to identify the unchanged supplier/M0 recipes.
Each SDK producer additionally binds all SDK and shared recipe files, effective
compile/link/archive settings, exact static archive components and final Host
bytes. `sdk_recipe.sha256` and `sdk.sha256` are separate identities; runtime
results in `run` reports retain both. An SDK build or local smoke does not certify
the full M1 Cross/Full matrix or release readiness.
